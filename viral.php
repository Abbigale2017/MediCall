            <h2>Causes</h2>
            <p>
               Viral fever, as the name suggests, is a condition that is transmitted from 
			   one person to another through direct contact with the person’s bodily fluids. 
			   This is much simpler than you think. Here are some common causes of fever you didn’t know about.
               When a person coughs, sneezes, yawns or even talks they tend to spray tiny particles of fluid
			   that contain bacteria and viruses from their body. If you are close enough, these bacteria enter 
			   your body through your nose or mouth and infect you. Once infected it takes anywhere from 16 hours 
			   to 48 hours to turn into a full blown infection.

            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>
                Since the symptoms of viral fever often overlap other common and serious conditions it 
				is pertinent to know about the symptoms that can help you differentiate between a viral
				fever and other diseases. The red flags you need to keep an eye out for are – very high 
				fever that is either of the following:
<li>     Intermittent in nature (occurs at regular intervals)
<li>     Occurs along with chills
<li>     Doesn’t subside with medicines
<li>	 Has been present for a long time
             Other symptoms are severe pain around the joints, vomiting, swelling of the face and
             a rash. If you experience any of these symptoms make it a point to visit your doctor immediately.
